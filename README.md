# Unsupervised-learning-for-IoT-Anomaly-Detection-in-Smart-Buildings
This project is an integral component of a BSc Computer Science thesis at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

Abstract
As sensor networks proliferate across a wide range of applications, efficient anomaly
detection techniques have become increasingly essential. This project presents a comprehensive approach for detecting anomalies in multivariate real-time series data generated by sensors situated in various rooms of Vrije Universiteitâ€™s NU building. The
proposed methodology leverages data clustering, data visualization techniques, and
room-type specific analysis to not only identify deviations from normal patterns but
also categorize them, distinguishing between various types of anomalies. The sensor
network setup includes various room types, such as meeting rooms and two-person
rooms, each exhibiting unique patterns and requirements that need customized analysis
